    <h3>Reasons:</h3>
    <p> People often ask me why I do so many strange sports. Well the truth is that I find being scared to be a form of meditation. Fear I believe is a healthy part of life for so many reasons. A few for example, is that is makes you appreciate your life, reanalyzie what you are doing with your life, and motivate you to do the things that you want to do with you life! </p>
